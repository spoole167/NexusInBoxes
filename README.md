# Nexus In Boxes

This demo is designed to show Sonatypes portfolio
in action in a pseudo-realistic manner

The compose file is configured via environmental
variables. 

It is assumed you have an appropriate licence file(s) for
these products 

To get started copy the env_template file into the root
of this directory and rename it as ".env".

Now edit this .env file and fill in the environmental variable LIFECYCLE_LICENCE_FILE
with the full path to the licence file

Other variables in this file can be changed but the
demo can be launched with no other changes
